# typeofAnything

Ecmascript can be a bitch when it comes to (determining) the type of variables. Sometimes `typeof`/`instanceof`/`constructor` etc. will 
just not give the right results.

This little module/library tries to provide a function to determine a type more extensively. It is available as an (importable) module or a browser script.
